# GDPR-compliant-YouTube-Videos-Shortcode-for-BeTheme

Many websites embed YouTube videos using standard methods provided by WordPress (Classic Editor, Gutenberg) or popular page builders like Oxygen. However, doing so without first obtaining user consent may violate the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

Why? Because as soon as a page with an embedded YouTube video is loaded, a connection to YouTube's servers is established—just to fetch the preview image. This connection already transmits personal data (such as the visitor's IP address) to YouTube, which is not permitted without explicit consent.

This raises an important question:
How can you embed YouTube videos on your website in a GDPR-compliant way?
